For clean architecture, we use 3 major folders:
    - data
        - sources
        - repository
        - models
    - doamin
        - entites
        - repositories
        - usecases
    - presentation
        - bloc
        - pages
        - widgets

In addition, you can have the following folders:
    - common
    - core

Then you create a roadmap like this:
